# Voice-assistant
Desktop voice assistant : 
This project develops a Python-based voice assistant leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand user intent and execute tasks.

Key Components

- Speech recognition (speech_recognition library)
- Speech synthesis (pyttsx3 library)
- Text classification (scikit-learn library)

Workflow

1. Initialize speech recognition and synthesis components
2. Listen to user input through microphone
3. Recognize intent using trained text classification model
4. Execute tasks based on predicted category (information retrieval, video playback, news reading)

Features

- Integration with external APIs (Wikipedia, YouTube)
- Supported tasks: information retrieval, video playback, news reading

Technologies

- Python
- NLP
- Machine learning
- scikit-learn
